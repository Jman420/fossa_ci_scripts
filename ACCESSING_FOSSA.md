# Accessing FOSSA

Medidata's FOSSA instance should only be accessed through OKTA.  Attempting to access FOSSA through other authentication mechanisms (email, Google, etc.) will not provide access to the FOSSA Medidata Org.

## Steps
  - Login to OKTA
  - Serach for the FOSSA Chicklet
  - Request access to the FOSSA Chicklet
  - Once access is granted click the FOSSA Chicklet to access the FOSSA Platform
