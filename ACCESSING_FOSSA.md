# Accessing FOSSA

Medidata's FOSSA instance should only be accessed through OKTA.  Attempting to access FOSSA through other authentication mechanisms (email, Google, etc.) will not provide access to the FOSSA Medidata Org.

## Steps
  - Login to OKTA
  - Find FOSSA in OKTA and click on it's Icon
  - Upon successful first login you should see the FOSSA Platform Homepage with no Projects listed
  - Contact InfoSec (Justin Giannone or Patrick Ryga) to request access to the appropriate Projects within FOSSA
  - After access has been granted subsequent logins will show Available Projects on the FOSSA Platform Homepage
